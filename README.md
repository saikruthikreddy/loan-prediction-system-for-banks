This project predicts loan approval status (`Loan_Status`) using a machine learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training with hyperparameter tuning. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data. Exploratory analysis visualizes data distributions and relationships, while a Logistic Regression model, optimized with GridSearchCV, is trained and evaluated on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics. The results provide insights into factors influencing loan approval, with scope for exploring other advanced models and metrics.
